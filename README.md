# MCTS_tictactoe
I would like to create a simple front-end website with coversion from Python to JavaScript, using the MCTS algorithm to play tic-tac-toe, so players can play it locally

### How to launch 
The browser can be launched through Node.JS Developement servers since it offers more sophisticated JavaScript tools.

The code below illustrate how to download and launch the browser locally using servers provided by Node.

```
# Install globally
npm install -g live-server

# Run in your project directory
live-server
```
